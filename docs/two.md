### Abstract

This is the second article. Here we are testing math formulas and embedded `svg`.

## 1. Testing

### 1.1 Math Formulas

[Euler's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity) is said to be one of the most beautiful formulas, as it collects the most fundamental numbers in mathematics in a compact equation (1).

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$ (1)
